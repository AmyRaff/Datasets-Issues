# Datasets-Issues

Supporting code for our paper **Limitations of Public Chest Radiography Datasets for Artificial Intelligence: Label Quality, Domain Shift, Bias and Evaluation Challenges**, by Amy Rafferty, Rishi Ramaesh and Ajitha Rajan.

Included scripts:
- Data pre-processing and undersampling
- Training scripts for each of the seven model architectures
- Evaluation scripts for both threshold-dependant and threshold-independant evaluations

**NOTE:** Scripts are currently set up for use with a GPU.
